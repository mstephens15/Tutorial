To setup a new directory:
1. Create the repo in github
2. git init
3. echo "# Tutorial" >> README.md
4. git add README.md (and any other files too)
5. git commit -m 'this is where a message will go'
6. git push -u origin master

To see status: git status
To unstage (not include new file): git rm --cached [file]
To clean out untracked files: git clean -fx
To delete: git rm [file]

Notes:
-Adding folders requires there to be at least one file in it.
-It will ask for password every time I push something
-Deleting files doesnt work i guess, so on github manually remove it after using that delete line

For Pull:
-git pull origin master --> if it gives error message that local repo is behind
